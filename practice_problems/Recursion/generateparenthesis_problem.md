<p>Generating all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given number of pairs is an interesting problem that can be efficiently solved using recursion. The idea is to keep track of the number of opening and closing brackets we have placed and ensure that we never place a closing bracket before its corresponding opening bracket.

<strong>Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:</strong>

1. **Initialize:** Start with an empty string and two counts, one for the number of opening parentheses and one for the number of closing parentheses.

2. **Recursive Logic:**
   - If the count of opening parentheses is less than `n`, we can put an opening parenthesis and recurse.
   - If the count of closing parentheses is less than the count of opening parentheses, we can put a closing parenthesis and recurse.

3. **Base Condition:** When the count of both opening and closing parentheses reaches `n`, we have a valid combination.

4. **Return or Store the Result:** Once we have a valid combination, we can return it or store it in a list.

Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```python
def generateParenthesis(n):
    def backtrack(s='', left=0, right=0):
        if len(s) == 2 * n:
            result.append(s)
            return
        if left < n:
            backtrack(s + '(', left + 1, right)
        if right < left:
            backtrack(s + ')', left, right + 1)

    result = []
    backtrack()
    return result

# Example Usage
print(generateParenthesis(3))  # Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
print(generateParenthesis(1))  # Output: ["()"]
```

In this implementation, `backtrack` is the recursive function that builds the combinations. `left` and `right` keep track of the count of opening and closing parentheses, respectively. We add parentheses to the string `s` and when the base condition is met (the length of `s` is `2 * n`), we add the combination to the `result` list.</p>
