To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers from the range `[1, n]`. Let's break down the task and understand it with an example.

### Understanding Combinations:

In mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a larger set such that the order of selection does not matter. For instance, if you have a set `{1, 2, 3}`, the combinations of size 2 are `{1, 2}`, `{1, 3}`, and `{2, 3}`. Notice that `{2, 1}` is not listed separately because in combinations, the order doesn't matter, so `{1, 2}` and `{2, 1}` are considered the same.

### Problem Explanation:

Given two integers `n` and `k`:
- `n` is the size of the set. In this case, the set is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
- `k` is the size of each combination to be selected from the set.

### Example: `n = 4`, `k = 2`

- The set from which we select is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- We need to find all possible combinations of size `2`.

Here's how we do it:

1. Start with the first number, `1`. Combine it with each of the following numbers: `2`, `3`, and `4`. This gives us `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[1, 4]`.

2. Move to the next number, `2`. Combine it with numbers after it: `3`, and `4`. This gives us `[2, 3]` and `[2, 4]`.

3. Finally, combine `3` and `4` to get `[3, 4]`.

Thus, the output is `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]`.

### Approach for Solution:

To implement this, you typically use recursion or iterative approaches (like backtracking) to generate combinations. You'll pick each element and then combine it with subsequent elements, ensuring you don't repeat combinations.

### Simplified Example:

Let's consider a simpler example: `n = 3`, `k = 2`.

- The set is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- We need combinations of size `2`.

Steps:
1. Combine `1` with `2` and `3`: `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`.
2. Combine `2` with `3`: `[2, 3]`.

Output: `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]`.

This problem is a classic example of combinatorial generation, often solved using recursion or iterative approaches in programming. It's a great example to understand recursion and the concept of combinations in depth.
====================
Let's walk through the recursive function `combine(4, 2)` with a detailed explanation of each recursion and the use of `pop()`. We'll use a numerical example to make it clear.

### Example: `combine(4, 2)`

1. **Initial Call**: `combine(4, 2)` initializes `result = []` and starts `backtrack(1, [])`.

2. **First Call to `backtrack`**: `backtrack(1, [])`
   - Loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - Path becomes `[1]`.
   - Recursively calls `backtrack(2, [1])`.

3. **Second Call to `backtrack`**: `backtrack(2, [1])`
   - Loop starts with `i = 2`.
   - Path becomes `[1, 2]`.
   - Since path length is now 2 (`k`), add `[1, 2]` to `result`.
   - `pop()` is called, removing `2`. Path becomes `[1]`.

4. **Continuing Second Call**: After popping, `i` increments to `3`.
   - Path becomes `[1, 3]`.
   - Add `[1, 3]` to `result`.
   - `pop()` is called, removing `3`. Path becomes `[1]`.

5. **Continuing Second Call**: `i` increments to `4`.
   - Path becomes `[1, 4]`.
   - Add `[1, 4]` to `result`.
   - `pop()` is called, removing `4`. Path becomes `[1]`.

6. **Back to First Call**: After fully exploring with starting `1`, `pop()` removes `1` from the path. Path is now `[]`.

7. **Continuing First Call**: `i` increments to `2`.
   - Path becomes `[2]`.
   - Recursively calls `backtrack(3, [2])`.

8. **Third Call to `backtrack`**: `backtrack(3, [2])`
   - Loop starts with `i = 3`.
   - Path becomes `[2, 3]`.
   - Add `[2, 3]` to `result`.
   - `pop()` is called, removing `3`. Path becomes `[2]`.

9. **Continuing Third Call**: `i` increments to `4`.
   - Path becomes `[2, 4]`.
   - Add `[2, 4]` to `result`.
   - `pop()` is called, removing `4`. Path becomes `[2]`.

10. **Back to First Call**: After fully exploring with starting `2`, `pop()` removes `2` from the path. Path is now `[]`.

11. **Continuing First Call**: `i` increments to `3`.
    - Path becomes `[3]`.
    - Recursively calls `backtrack(4, [3])`.

12. **Fourth Call to `backtrack`**: `backtrack(4, [3])`
    - Loop starts with `i = 4`.
    - Path becomes `[3, 4]`.
    - Add `[3, 4]` to `result`.
    - `pop()` is called, removing `4`. Path becomes `[3]`.

13. **Back to First Call**: After fully exploring with starting `3`, `pop()` removes `3` from the path. Path is now `[]`.

14. **Completion**: All possibilities have been explored.

### Final Result:
`result` contains all combinations of size 2 from the set `[1, 2, 3, 4]`: `[[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]`.

### Key Points:
- **Recursion**: We dive deeper into combinations by adding elements and calling `backtrack` recursively.
- **Backtracking (pop())**: We remove the last element from the path to backtrack and explore other combinations. This step is crucial to avoid repeating elements and to reset the path for new possibilities.
