Sorting and searching:
Important note from : <a>https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/sorting-searching/</a>
"A number of basic algorithms run in O(n2) and should not be used in interviews. In algorithm interviews, you're unlikely to need to implement any of the sorting algorithms from scratch. Instead you would need to sort the input using your language's default sorting function so that you can use binary searches on them."
