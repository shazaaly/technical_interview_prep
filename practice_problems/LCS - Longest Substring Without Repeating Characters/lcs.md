Let's walk through each iteration of the method `lengthOfLongestSubstring` for the string `"abcabcbb"` using the sliding window approach. I'll detail what happens in the variables `res`, `left`, `right`, and `charSet`.

### Initial Setup
- `res` (result) starts at `0`.
- `left` (start of the window) starts at `0`.
- `charSet` (to track unique characters in the current window) starts as an empty set.

### Iteration Overview
For `s = "abcabcbb"`:

1. **First Iteration (`right = 0`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'a'`.
   - `'a'` is not in `charSet`, so add `'a'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(1 - 0 + 1, 0) = 1`.

2. **Second Iteration (`right = 1`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'b'`.
   - `'b'` is not in `charSet`, so add `'b'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(2 - 0 + 1, 1) = 2`.

3. **Third Iteration (`right = 2`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'c'`.
   - `'c'` is not in `charSet`, so add `'c'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(3 - 0 + 1, 2) = 3`.

4. **Fourth Iteration (`right = 3`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'a'`.
   - `'a'` is in `charSet`, so we enter the while loop. Remove `'a'` from `charSet` and increment `left` to `1`.
   - Now `'a'` is not in `charSet`, so add `'a'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(4 - 1 + 1, 3) = 3`.

5. **Fifth Iteration (`right = 4`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'b'`.
   - `'b'` is in `charSet`, so remove characters starting from `left` until `'b'` is removed. After removing `'b'`, `left` is `2`.
   - Add `'b'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(5 - 2 + 1, 3) = 3`.

6. **Sixth Iteration (`right = 5`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'c'`.
   - `'c'` is in `charSet`, so repeat the process as in the fifth iteration. After removing `'c'`, `left` is `3`.
   - Add `'c'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(6 - 3 + 1, 3) = 3`.

7. **Seventh Iteration (`right = 6`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'b'`.
   - `'b'` is not in `charSet` after the previous iterations, so add `'b'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(7 - 3 + 1, 3) = 4`.

8. **Eighth Iteration (`right = 7`)**:
   - `s[right]` is `'b'`.
   - `'b'` is in `charSet`, so remove characters starting from `left` until `'b'` is removed. After removing `'b'`, `left` is `4`.
   - Add `'b'` to `charSet`.
   - Update `res` to `max(8 - 4 + 1, 4) = 4`.

### Conclusion
After the final iteration, `res` holds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, which is `4` in this case. The longest substring without repeating characters for `"abcabcbb"` is `"abcb"`, which has a length of 4.
The sliding window approach efficiently manages the checking of substrings by dynamically adjusting the window size as it encounters repeating characters. This approach is particularly effective for this type of problem, as it minimizes the need to repeatedly scan the entire string, leading to an overall time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the string.
